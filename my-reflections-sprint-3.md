# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Yes I do have a biase both for mindfulness. I use to practise lucid dreaming and go to counseling when I was yonger
I learned to build patterns to help me process my emtions in a heathy manner. Being emtionally intelligent is having the self awareness to 
known what yourself are feeling and to take steps to not make lash out or become stuck in  either self destuctive or extenally dustructive cycles/habits like lashing out at someone or something. The self awakerness it take is similar to lucid dreaming in where you train youself to notice details that are absent in a dream so you recognised you are in a dream and can then take control however emtional control is lot harder than lucid dreaming being that simple self-awareness does not auto-mattically allow you to control your emtions .



### How did you find the overall experience? 
I found it peaceful though hard at time to same in one place for long periods of time, I found doing breathing excuse helped alot.


### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
Trying to set goals on sleep, I already do some mindfulness habits like counting my fingers and stopping to observe the words and myself when I'm going about my day. I will try to set sleep goals and work goals, to get a certian amount of work finished and to only work consistanly with a good break that does not slip over into work time.



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

It is validating to feel like I am being listen to completely.

### What was it like to fully listen?

 Something was harder than I thought, I can listen to someone but when I think of way to help I wanted to speak straight away. It took praticuls to remember I needed to stay scilent the whole while and LISTEN to THEM.    




# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I found it increasingly difficult to learn off the screen, I need more examples of how and why a  thing is done is java as well as what was and as not a function java could do. I found a explenation do in person or a snort if concise one to covert what the element did was more useful than anything else.  

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

No I do not feel like I master java or even got most of the basics, however I did gain a good understand of my gapes in knownlage and how I can fill them.
The logic of loops very much confused me as well the contects of functions. I also made very many small mistakes, like not putting a , at the end of my lines that cost hours of work as I had to go back and find where I missed it.





# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?
I was difficult as I kept making small mistakes that would break the code and have me start over. I was intimidated by both the DOMS and Java's complexatiy 


### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?
I needed to slow down to learn better, aslo playing with new concept helped me learn them but I coudln't get concole log to work which was one of the main way the imformation of explained. I needed to go though all my line of code mythodically in order to get it to work.
