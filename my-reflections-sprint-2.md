# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

 Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

I used termial to make a folder to then to create two specific files. One for the contents of the wedsite which is html and another to change up how the wedsite would look which is CSS. I then linked the files togather so they would act togather. 


### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?
I went a little over the time but kept I got stuck on what I thought was an error but with the link on being able to find the css file and created a new file but after i added .. the error fixed itself, the errors i kept getting were small things like putting the / in the wrong order.




# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
Some of the obstacles I came across were again when to close off a value with <> or with "". When doing the challenges I would keep failing it for what I thought was no reason at all so I would reload the challange then try it out again. I would use hint as much as possible but when I could not complete it I would watch the video's they provided which would provide with an the correct solutions.


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
I am proud that I used the video option only after I had done everything else I could think of, I would try at lest three different solutions before I resoprted to the video.

I found using CSS to be more harder than HTML but it more satisfying when I got something from CSS to work 


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
I found that I had to re-watch the youtude video 3-4 time before I could understand and replicate what he was doing. Going onto wed-site and looking at their DOM seemed intimidating but after going though experimenting a little bit with them I found it wasn't as complex as I feared, I got a basic grasp of what was happening on the page 


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
I need to stop and take a breath, step away from my computer and do a something else. If I was still having a the same problem or block I went onto youtude or google to find alternate solutions 


### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I have 7-8 tab open at once usually all the time when working on this sprint.
I had to close many of them as they were making it harder to find the information I wanted. It would slow me down as I would spend time looking for which tab I wanted. 

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

No I did not do anything funny but I most played arounded with the margins of the page.


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

 The two files are like silicone and moulds. One is what will be on the wedsite(the silicone) while the other is what the wedsite will look like(the moulds) The silicone is HTML and the mould is CSS. This is not a perfect analogy a better way to think it is:If an artiest was making a rubber statue he would pick out what how much silicone, the location the statue would be place and what kind of shape he wanted the mould to be. Being an artiest when got the silicon and the mould, he used his art tools to change things up, he used an art scalpt to make the teeth in the mould sharp, he mixed paint with the silicon so it would have different colours and put glass balls where the eyes would be so the sun would shine when it hit the statue. HTML is the basic mould and silicion while the art-supply is CSS

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

Getting CSS to work is suprsingly satisficing and I found the challenges in the code camp to fun.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
I think HTML is a beaver, it make an environment to live in while CSS is like a fish, it gives colour and life to the water, making the enviroment more interesting to live in.
